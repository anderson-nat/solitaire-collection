/**
 * Pyramid is a patience or solitaire game where the object is to get all the cards from the pyramid to the foundation.
 * The object of the game is to remove pairs of cards that add up to a total of 13, the equivalent of the highest
 * valued card in the deck, from a pyramid arrangement of 28 cards. When using the standard 52-card deck, Jacks are
 * valued at 11, Queens at 12, and Kings at 13. Under the strictest rules, the odds of winning are around 1 in 50.
