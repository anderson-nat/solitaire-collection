/**
 * Tri Peaks (also known as Three Peaks, Tri Towers or Triple Peaks) is a patience or solitaire card game that is akin
 * to the solitaire games Golf and Black Hole. The game uses one deck and the object is to clear three peaks made up of
 * cards. It was created by Robert Hogue in 1989, and popularized as a result of being included in Microsoft Solitaire
 * Collection.
