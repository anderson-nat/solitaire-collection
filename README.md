# solitaire-collection
An offline collection of solitaire gamemodes that keeps track of the users statistics. Current gamemodes include klondike, spider, pyramid, tripeaks, and freecell.

This is very much still a work in progress. And by that I mean I just started this project and there is very little actual code present currently.
